##	Deployment Guide:
	1. open the folder in VS code.
	2. if errors are shown in code, run "flutter pub get" to download missing packages.
	3. create an emulator/simulator in Android Studio/Xcode, or connect to a physical device.
	4. in VS code, choose a device and run main.dart.
	5. after debugging, run "flutter clean" to delete build files, otherwise the folder size grows too large.
